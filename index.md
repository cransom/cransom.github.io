<h2 style="text-align: center;">My struggle to be as lazy as possible.</h2>

##


Not lazy in the way you are probably thinking. I'm taking it back. I mean lazy in the sense where you do as much work as
needed in order to not have to do *more* work in the future. It's a delicate balance and even has at least one
[XKCD comic](https://xkcd.com/1205/) about it. It's a zen where you work on a task, thinking about all of the ways
in the future that it might blow up on you and you take the extra steps to not have that future failure.

It can take a lot of work to be productively lazy. Check [[about|here]] if you want to learn more about my super hero
origins.
